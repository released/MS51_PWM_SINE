# MS51_PWM_SINE
 MS51_PWM_SINE

update @ 2021/03/19

1. initial P0.3 (PWM0_CH5) , test PWM (with RC circuit , will be sine wave 60Hz) with MS51 EVM 

2. by connect PWM pin and covert with external RC circuit for DC voltage , below is waveform capture

up : DC result (convert by RC circuit)

down : MCU PWM
